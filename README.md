# Obfuscator
JavaScript obfuscation is the process of transforming JavaScript code into a new version that is difficult to understand and reverse-engineer. This technique helps protect your code from being easily read and understood by others, which is particularly useful when hosting your project on GitHub Pages, where the source code is publicly accessible.
